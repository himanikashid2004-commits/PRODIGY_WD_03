# Task-03: Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their **demographic and behavioral data**. The objective is to analyze customer information and create a predictive model that helps in understanding customer purchasing behavior.

The dataset used is inspired by the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Build a machine learning model using a **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Predict customer purchase decisions (Yes/No)
- Analyze demographic and behavioral factors influencing purchases
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
